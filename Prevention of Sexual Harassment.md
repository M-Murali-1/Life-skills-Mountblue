   - Making comments about someone’s looks, body, or sexuality, or telling sexual jokes that are not suitable.

3. **Unwanted Advances**  
   - Asking for dates or making sexual requests that are not welcomed, or suggesting that promotions depend on sexual favors.

4. **Showing Inappropriate Content**  
   - Sharing or displaying sexual images, videos, or messages at work.

5. **Staring or Suggestive Gestures**  
   - Staring or making sexual gestures that make someone feel uncomfortable.

6. **Threats or Punishment**  
   - Threatening to harm someone’s job for saying no to romantic or sexual advances, or punishing them for reporting harassment.
